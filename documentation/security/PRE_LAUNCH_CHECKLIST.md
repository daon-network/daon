# Pre-Launch Security Checklist

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Complete these items before public launch**

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - MUST DO BEFORE PUBLIC LAUNCH

### 1. Regenerate API Wallet Mnemonic
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** Currently using default/example mnemonic from development

**Current mnemonic (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION):**
```
blur cause boost pass stick allow hundred odor level erosion umbrella urban need indicate inject funny anchor kiss rain equal among unhappy sad dutch
```

**Action Required:**
1. Generate new secure mnemonic with proper entropy
2. Fund the new wallet with sufficient tokens for operations
3. Update GitHub Secret: `API_MNEMONIC`
4. Redeploy all services
5. Securely backup the new mnemonic (encrypted, offline storage)
6. Destroy all copies of the old mnemonic

**Commands:**
```bash
# Generate new mnemonic (run locally, not on server)
daond keys add api-wallet-new --keyring-backend test

# This will output a 24-word mnemonic - SAVE IT SECURELY!
# Then update GitHub secret:
gh secret set API_MNEMONIC -b"<NEW_MNEMONIC_HERE>"

# Trigger redeployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger redeployment with new wallet"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Rotate All Production Secrets
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Risk Level:** HIGH

Secrets to rotate:
- [ ] `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Database password
- [ ] `API_KEY_SECRET` - API key signing secret
- [ ] `API_MNEMONIC` - Blockchain wallet (see above)
- [ ] `SERVER_SSH_KEY` - Deployment SSH key

### 3. Enable Production Security Features
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

- [ ] Enable rate limiting (currently disabled in test mode)
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domains only
- [ ] Enable request logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (block all except 80, 443, 22)

### 4. Blockchain Security
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Risk Level:** HIGH

- [ ] Ensure validator key is properly secured
- [ ] Backup validator private key to secure offline storage
- [ ] Set up validator monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure stake/bond amounts appropriately
- [ ] Set minimum gas prices for spam prevention

### 5. Infrastructure Hardening
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

- [ ] SSH: Disable password auth, key-only
- [ ] SSH: Change default port from 22
- [ ] Set up fail2ban for SSH brute force protection
- [ ] Configure automatic security updates
- [ ] Set up log rotation and retention policies
- [ ] Enable audit logging

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - BEFORE PUBLIC LAUNCH

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom, etc.)
- [ ] Configure alerts for service failures
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (Papertrail, Loggly, etc.)
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)
- [ ] Set up blockchain metrics monitoring

### 7. Backup & Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Automated PostgreSQL backups (daily)
- [ ] Automated blockchain state backups
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedure
- [ ] Document disaster recovery runbook
- [ ] Set up off-site backup storage

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Document all production credentials storage locations
- [ ] Create incident response playbook
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Create runbook for common operational tasks

## 🟢 NICE TO HAVE - CAN BE DONE AFTER LAUNCH

### 9. Advanced Security
- [ ] Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Configure DDoS protection (Cloudflare, etc.)
- [ ] Implement API request signing
- [ ] Set up security scanning (automated vulnerability scanning)
- [ ] Configure Content Security Policy headers

### 10. Compliance & Legal
- [ ] Privacy policy published
- [ ] Terms of service published
- [ ] GDPR compliance review (if applicable)
- [ ] Security audit by third party
- [ ] Penetration testing

## Timeline Recommendation

**Minimum 1 week before public announcement:**
1. Complete all HIGH PRIORITY items
2. Test all security measures
3. Verify backups are working
4. Run security scan

**Day before launch:**
1. Final security review
2. Verify all secrets are production-ready
3. Test disaster recovery procedures
4. Ensure monitoring is active

**Launch day:**
1. Monitor all systems closely
2. Have incident response team ready
3. Watch for unusual activity
