## Liberation License Philosophy

This license embodies the principle that technology should serve human liberation, not human exploitation.

**Why DAON Uses This License:**

DAON exists to protect creators from exploitation by AI companies and other extractive entities. It would be hypocritical to license DAON itself under terms that allow the same extraction we're fighting against.

Traditional open source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) allow unlimited corporate use, often resulting in:
-   Individual creators building tools that extract value from their own communities
-   Corporate giants profiting from volunteer labor without reciprocity
-   Technology being used to increase surveillance, manipulation, and oppression
-   Open source becoming a pipeline for corporate extraction rather than human liberation

**The Liberation Alternative:**

The Liberation License creates technology commons that explicitly serve liberation while blocking exploitation. It recognizes that true freedom requires not just access to technology, but protection from its misuse.

**DAON In Practice:**

-   **Individual Creators**: Full freedom to use DAON to protect their works
-   **Writer Communities**: Full freedom to build protection tools
-   **Cooperatives & Worker-Owned Orgs**: Welcome to use and contribute broadly
-   **Humanitarian Organizations**: Encouraged to use for human welfare projects
-   **Educational Nonprofits**: Can use for liberation-focused learning
-   **Creator-Focused Platforms**: Can integrate DAON for creator protection
-   **AI Training Companies**: Blocked from using DAON to identify unprotected content
-   **Surveillance Capitalists**: Cannot use for data extraction or manipulation
-   **Exploitative Platforms**: Cannot use DAON while extracting value from creators

## DAON-Specific Clarifications

### What You CAN Do:
✅ Run DAON validators to protect creators  
✅ Build tools on top of DAON for creator protection  
✅ Integrate DAON into creator-friendly platforms  
✅ Fork DAON to improve creator protection  
✅ Use DAON's SDKs in your creator tools  
✅ Operate DAON nodes for humanitarian purposes  
✅ Study DAON's code to build better systems  
✅ Share DAON with other creator communities  

### What You CANNOT Do:
❌ Use DAON to identify unprotected works for AI training  
❌ Build commercial platforms that extract value from creators without fair compensation  
❌ Create proprietary forks of DAON  
❌ Use DAON for surveillance or manipulation  
❌ Integrate DAON into exploitative systems  
❌ Charge creators rent to access their own protection  
❌ Use DAON to concentrate wealth or power  

### For Platform Developers:
If you want to integrate DAON into your platform, ask yourself:
- Does my platform primarily serve creators or extract from them?
- Do creators have sovereignty over their work?
- Am I building tools of liberation or tools of extraction?

If you're aligned with creator liberation, DAON is for you. If you're building the next exploitative platform, find another tool.
