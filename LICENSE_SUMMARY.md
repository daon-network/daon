## 🎯 Why This License for DAON

**DAON's Mission:** Protect creators from AI exploitation

**License Alignment:** It would be hypocritical to license DAON under terms (like MIT) that allow the same extraction we're fighting against.

**Traditional Open Source Problem:**
- MIT/Apache licenses allow unlimited corporate use
- Corporate giants profit from volunteer labor without reciprocity
- Technology used to increase surveillance and oppression
- Open source becomes pipeline for extraction, not liberation

**Liberation License Solution:**
- Creates technology commons that explicitly serve liberation
- Blocks exploitation while enabling freedom
- Protects creators while remaining accessible
- Aligns legal terms with ethical mission
