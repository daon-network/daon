## 🔍 FAQ

### **"Is this really free?"**
Yes, completely free. No subscriptions, no limits, no hidden costs. Creator protection should be accessible to everyone.

### **"What if I don't trust blockchain?"**
You don't have to! DAON just stores a cryptographic fingerprint, not your content. Your work stays exactly where it is.

### **"Will this slow down my website?"**
No. Protection happens in the background after publishing. Zero impact on site speed or visitor experience.

### **"What if DAON disappears?"**
Your protection records are stored on a distributed blockchain with validators worldwide. No single point of failure.

### **"Can I remove protection later?"**
You can stop protecting new work anytime. Existing protection records are permanent (that's the point - proof can't be erased).

### **"Does this work internationally?"**
Yes! DAON is hosted in Europe under GDPR protection, and blockchain records are global and immutable.

### **"What about fair use?"**
Liberation License explicitly allows fair use, education, research, and personal use. It only blocks commercial exploitation without compensation.

### **"How do I prove someone violated my work?"**
The blockchain record provides cryptographic proof you created the content first. This is admissible evidence in court proceedings.

- **Liberation License blocks** corporate exploitation without compensation
- **Legal standing** to fight violations with real evidence
- **Community of protected creators** supporting each other
