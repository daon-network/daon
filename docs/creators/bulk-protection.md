## 🔍 FAQ

### **"How long does bulk protection take?"**
Approximately 1-3 seconds per file. 1,000 files typically take 30-60 minutes total.

### **"What if some files fail to protect?"**
The tool logs all failures with reasons. Most can be retried after fixing the issue (file size, format, etc.).

### **"Does this use my API limits?"**
Yes. Free tier includes 1,000 protections/month. Paid tiers available for larger collections.

### **"Can I protect the same content multiple times?"**
The tool automatically detects and skips already-protected content unless you force re-protection.

### **"What file formats are supported?"**
Text (.txt), Markdown (.md), Word (.docx), PDF (.pdf), HTML (.html), RTF (.rtf), and various export formats.

### **"What if I have huge files (>10MB)?"**
Split large files into chapters or sections, or use the web upload tool for individual large works.

### **"Does this work offline?"**
No, protection requires internet connection to write to the blockchain. However, the tool can queue protections for when you're back online.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Before You Start**
- **Organize files** into logical directories first
- **Run dry-run** to see what will be protected
- **Check file sizes** - split anything over 10MB
- **Have good internet** - uploads can be bandwidth intensive

### **During Protection**
- **Don't interrupt** the process once started
- **Monitor progress** for any error patterns
- **Keep computer awake** to prevent sleep during long runs

### **After Protection**
- **Save verification links** somewhere safe
- **Test a few verification URLs** to confirm they work
- **Share links** when you need to prove ownership
- **Keep the results JSON** as a backup record
