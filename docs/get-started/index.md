# 🚀 Get Started with DAON Protection

**Protect your creative work from AI exploitation in just 2 minutes.** Choose your platform and follow the simple steps below.

---

## 🎯 Choose Your Protection Method

<div class="quick-options">

### 📝 **WordPress Blog Protection**
**Most popular - protects 40% of all websites**

1. **Install Plugin**
   - WordPress Admin → Plugins → Add New
   - Search "DAON Creator Protection"
   - Install & Activate

2. **Configure Protection**

---

### 📚 **AO3 Fanfiction Protection** 
**Protect works you have already published**

1. **Sign in** at [app.daon.network](https://app.daon.network)

2. **Paste your work**
   - One work at a time, text pasted in
   - Choose your licence terms

3. **Done!** Cryptographic proof, registered under your account

[🔗 Register a work](https://app.daon.network)

> **There is no DAON browser extension, and there will not be one.** An extension
> would have to hold your signing key in browser storage, which is an ordinary
> file with no hardware protection, and it could be silently updated by the web
> store for every user at once — so the code you trusted is not necessarily the
> code that runs tomorrow. A content script also only sees what the *site* sent
> to your browser, which is not evidence that you wrote anything.
>
> If you are ever offered a "DAON extension", it is not from us.

## ⚡ What Happens When You Protect Content?

<div class="how-it-works">

### 1. **Content Analysis** 🔍
DAON generates a unique SHA-256 cryptographic hash of your content

### 2. **Blockchain Registration** ⛓️
Your hash + metadata gets permanently recorded on DAON blockchain

### 3. **License Application** ⚖️
Liberation License blocks AI training without compensation

### 4. **Verification Proof** 📜
You get a permanent verification URL as legal evidence

</div>

---

## 📋 What Information is Stored?

✅ **STORED ON BLOCKCHAIN:**
- SHA-256 hash of your content (fingerprint)
- Creation timestamp
- Creator identifier (optional)
- License type (Liberation License v1)

❌ **NEVER STORED:**
- Your actual content text
- Personal information
- Platform passwords
- Private content details

> **Privacy First:** DAON only stores a mathematical fingerprint, never your actual creative work.

---

## 🔒 Understanding the Liberation License

**The Liberation License blocks exploitative AI training while preserving fair use:**

### ✅ **ALLOWED:**
- Personal reading and enjoyment
- Educational use and study
- Criticism and commentary
- Humanitarian purposes
- Non-commercial research

### ❌ **BLOCKED:**
- Commercial AI model training
- Scraping for profit without compensation
- Unauthorized commercial use
- Resale or redistribution

**Result:** AI companies must get permission and compensate creators fairly.

## 🛡️ How Protection Works Legally

### **Before DAON:**
- "I wrote this first!" ← Hard to prove
- No timestamped evidence
- Expensive legal battles
- Creators often lose

### **With DAON:**
- Blockchain timestamp proves creation date
- Cryptographic hash proves content ownership
- Liberation License sets clear usage terms
- Legal standing for enforcement

**Real Example:** *"My SHA-256 hash 7f8b9c2d... was registered on DAON blockchain at 2024-03-15 14:32:17 UTC, proving I created this content before your AI training dataset."*
