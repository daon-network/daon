## 🌟 **Vision for Year 3+**

### **The Ultimate Goal**
```
By 2028:
✓ Every major creative platform integrates CCC verification
✓ AI companies must check creator consent before training
✓ Creators have economic power in the AI value chain  
✓ International legal framework recognizes our standards
✓ "Check Creative Commons Chain first" becomes industry standard

The Public Utility Vision:
├── Free creator protection infrastructure (like public roads)
├── Sustainable through community and institutional support
├── Democratic governance by creator communities
├── Open source and legally unownable by any company
└── Global standard for digital creator rights
```

**And then... we tackle LLMs as public utilities! 😉**

*Let's build the infrastructure that puts creators back in control of their own work.*
